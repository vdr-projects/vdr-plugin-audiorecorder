2006-06-16: Version 0.1.0-pre1

- Initial revision.

2006-06-26: Version 0.1.0-pre2

- replaced localtime with thread-safe localtime_r (cAudioreceiver::get_path()).
- try to catch wrong rtp-tags (cRds::correct_rtp_tags()).
- add support for reencoding into mp3 format.

2006-06-26: Version 0.1.0-pre3

- a small bugfix in cRds::decode_rtp().

2006-07-17: Version 0.1.0-pre4

- complete rewrite of the recording stuff. now there are up to !!! 12 !!!
  parallel recordings possible (cDispatcher()).
- better/more checks of the rtp_tags (cRds::correct_rtp_tag()).
- fixed a bug in cRds::set_next_frame().
- some cosmetic changes.
- introduced service-interface for communication with other plugins
  (you can use the header file service.h).
- reduced the verbosity of the plugin. debugging could be enabled on stdout with
  the commandline argument -d or --debug=.

2006-09-01: Version 0.1.0-pre5

- added casts to uint64_t to avoid an integer overflow (suggested by egal &
  lordjaxom on www.vdrportal.de, cDispatcher::check_free_disc_space()).
- added "min. free disc space (in mb)" to setup menu. the recording is stopped
  if the free space on the recording-directory is smaller than this value
  (suggested by egal on www.vdrportal.de).
- added "max. tracks in queue" to setup menu. the recording is stopped if this
  value is achived. recording is startet again at 25 % of this value
  (suggested by egal on www.vdrportal.de).
- now artist and title are converted to capital letters (for better detecting
  of doubled recordings).
- after switching a channel, the next receiver is attached after at minimum
  30 seconds (thx to andipiel from www.vdrportal.de, cDispatcher()).
- removed track.c and track.h
- introduced caching (xml-base.[c,h], xml-cache.[c,h] and cache.[c,h]).
  tinyxml is used for the xml-handling, so thx a lot to the authors ...
  ... look at http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/ for more informations.
- introduced menu and browser (menu.[c,h], browse[c,h], browse-item[c,h])
- code cleanup, replaced most c-functions with the according c++/stl function.
- add "pause if osd is open" to setup menu.
- moved hr3, hr1 and swr3 to the end of the channels-list (dispatcher.c)
- added possible album, track or year-values (trackinfo.h)

2006-09-05: Version 0.1.0-pre6

- fixed a possible crash in cXmlCache::copy_to_objects()
- added the namespace "a-land" to tinyxml to avoid a segfault when used together
  with the setup plugin/path
