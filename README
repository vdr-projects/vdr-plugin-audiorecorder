See the file COPYING for license information.

Description:
Floods your disc with music! This plugin records songs with artist, title and ID3-Tag. The naming and cutting of the songs uses the "Radiotext plus" feature of the ARD channels "DAS MODUL", Eins_Live, YOU_FM, WDR_2, SWR3 etc., as long as the vdr is tuned to the transponder or if there is a unused DVB-card.

As codec you can choose between the native format mp2 MPEG-1_Audio_Layer_2 and mp3 (mit adjustable bitrate). More codecs are planned for the future.

Additionally you can add a fade-in and/or fade-out effect, to reduce unwanted noises at the beginning or the end of the song.

TODO: Add other recording mechanisms, e.g. PayRadio channels with title/artist in the EPG as Premiere, DMX, .... 

Parameters:
-r dir,   --recdir=dir    set recording-directory to 'dir'.
-d level, --debug=level   set debugging level (default: 0),
                          all stuff is written to stdout.
                          0 = off
                          1 = only errors
                          2 = errors and further infos
